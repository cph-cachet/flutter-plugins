# Health

Enables reading and writing health data from/to [Apple Health](https://www.apple.com/health/) and [Google Health Connect](https://health.google/health-connect-android/).

> **NOTE:** Google has deprecated the Google Fit API. According to the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/fit/android), as of **May 1st 2024** developers cannot sign up for using the API. As such, this package has removed support for Google Fit as of version 11.0.0 and users are urged to upgrade as soon as possible.

The plugin supports:

- handling permissions to access health data using the `hasPermissions`, `requestAuthorization`, `revokePermissions` methods.
- reading health data using the `getHealthDataFromTypes` method.
- writing health data using the `writeHealthData` method.
- writing workouts using the `writeWorkout` method.
- writing meals on iOS (Apple Health) & Android using the `writeMeal` method.
- writing audiograms on iOS using the `writeAudiogram` method.
- writing blood pressure data using the `writeBloodPressure` method.
- accessing total step counts using the `getTotalStepsInInterval` method.
- cleaning up duplicate data points via the `removeDuplicates` method.
- removing data of a given type in a selected period of time using the `delete` method.

Note that for Android, the target phone **needs** to have the [Health Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.healthdata&hl=en) app installed (which is currently in beta) and have access to the internet.

See the tables below for supported health and workout data types.

## Setup

### Apple Health (iOS)

First, add the following 2 entries to the `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will sync your data with the Apple Health app to give you better insights</string>
<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will sync your data with the Apple Health app to give you better insights</string>
```

Then, open your Flutter project in Xcode by right clicking on the "ios" folder and selecting "Open in Xcode". Next, enable "HealthKit" by adding a capability inside the "Signing & Capabilities" tab of the Runner target's settings.

### Google Health Connect (Android)

Health Connect requires the following lines in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file (see also the example app):

```xml
<!-- Check whether Health Connect is installed or not -->
<queries>
  <package android:name="com.google.android.apps.healthdata" />
  <intent>
    <action android:name="androidx.health.ACTION_SHOW_PERMISSIONS_RATIONALE" />
  </intent>
</queries>
```

In the Health Connect permissions activity there is a link to your privacy policy. You need to grant the Health Connect app access in order to link back to your privacy policy. In the example below, you should either replace `.MainActivity` with an activity that presents the privacy policy or have the Main Activity route the user to the policy. This step may be required to pass Google app review when requesting access to sensitive permissions.

```xml
<activity-alias
     android:name="ViewPermissionUsageActivity"
     android:exported="true"
     android:targetActivity=".MainActivity"
     android:permission="android.permission.START_VIEW_PERMISSION_USAGE">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW_PERMISSION_USAGE" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.HEALTH_PERMISSIONS" />
        </intent-filter>
</activity-alias>
```

For each data type you want to access, the READ and WRITE permissions need to be added to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. The list of [permissions](https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/plan/data-types#permissions) can be found here on the [data types](https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/plan/data-types) page.

An example of asking for permission to read and write heart rate data is shown below and more examples can also be found in the example app.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.health.READ_HEART_RATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.health.WRITE_HEART_RATE"/>
```

By default, Health Connect restricts read data to 30 days from when permission has been granted.

You can check and request access to historical data using the `isHealthDataHistoryAuthorized` and `requestHealthDataHistoryAuthorization` methods, respectively.

The above methods require the following permission to be declared:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.health.READ_HEALTH_DATA_HISTORY"/>
```

Accessing fitness data (e.g. Steps) requires permission to access the "Activity Recognition" API. To set it add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION"/>
```

Additionally, for workouts, if the distance of a workout is requested then the location permissions below are needed.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

Because this is labeled as a `dangerous` protection level, the permission system will not grant it automatically and it requires the user's action.
You can prompt the user for it using the [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) plugin.
Follow the plugin setup instructions and add the following line before requesting the data:

```dart
await Permission.activityRecognition.request();
await Permission.location.request();
```

Finally, an `intent-filter` needs to be added to the `.MainActivity` activity.

```xml
<activity
  android:name=".MainActivity"
  android:exported="true"

  ....

  <!-- Intention to show Permissions screen for Health Connect API -->
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="androidx.health.ACTION_SHOW_PERMISSIONS_RATIONALE" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

There's a `debug`, `main` and `profile` version which are chosen depending on how you start your app. In general, it's sufficient to add permission only to the `main` version.

#### Android 14

This plugin uses the new `registerForActivityResult` when requesting permissions from Health Connect.
In order for that to work, the Main app's activity should extend `FlutterFragmentActivity` instead of `FlutterActivity`.
This adjustment allows casting from `Activity` to `ComponentActivity` for accessing `registerForActivityResult`.

In your MainActivity.kt file, update the `MainActivity` class so that it extends `FlutterFragmentActivity` instead of the default `FlutterActivity`:

```kotlin
...
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterFragmentActivity
...

class MainActivity: FlutterFragmentActivity() {
...
}
```

#### Android X

Replace the content of the `android/gradle.properties` file with the following lines:

```bash
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1536M
android.enableJetifier=true
android.useAndroidX=true
```

## Usage

See the example app for detailed examples of how to use the Health API.

A instance of the Health plugin is create using the `Health()` constructor and is subsequently configured calling the `configure` method. Once configured, the plugin can be used for handling permissions and getting and adding data to Apple Health or Google Health Connect.
Below is a simplified flow of how to use the plugin.

```dart

  // Global Health instance
  final health = Health();

  // configure the health plugin before use.
  await health.configure();


  // define the types to get
  var types = [
    HealthDataType.STEPS,
    HealthDataType.BLOOD_GLUCOSE,
  ];

  // requesting access to the data types before reading them
  bool requested = await health.requestAuthorization(types);

  var now = DateTime.now();

  // fetch health data from the last 24 hours
  List<HealthDataPoint> healthData = await health.getHealthDataFromTypes(
     now.subtract(Duration(days: 1)), now, types);

  // request permissions to write steps and blood glucose
  types = [HealthDataType.STEPS, HealthDataType.BLOOD_GLUCOSE];
  var permissions = [
      HealthDataAccess.READ_WRITE,
      HealthDataAccess.READ_WRITE
  ];
  await health.requestAuthorization(types, permissions: permissions);

  // write steps and blood glucose
  bool success = await health.writeHealthData(10, HealthDataType.STEPS, now, now);
  success = await health.writeHealthData(3.1, HealthDataType.BLOOD_GLUCOSE, now, now);

  // you can also specify the recording method to store in the metadata (default is RecordingMethod.automatic)
  // on iOS only `RecordingMethod.automatic` and `RecordingMethod.manual` are supported
  // Android additionally supports `RecordingMethod.active` and `RecordingMethod.unknown`
  success &= await health.writeHealthData(10, HealthDataType.STEPS, now, now, recordingMethod: RecordingMethod.manual);

  // get the number of steps for today
  var midnight = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day);
  int? steps = await health.getTotalStepsInInterval(midnight, now);
```

### Health Data

A [`HealthDataPoint`](https://pub.dev/documentation/health/latest/health/HealthDataPoint-class.html) object contains the following data fields:

```dart
String uuid;
HealthValue value;
HealthDataType type;
HealthDataUnit unit;
DateTime dateFrom;
DateTime dateTo;
HealthPlatformType sourcePlatform;
String sourceDeviceId;
String sourceId;
String sourceName;
RecordingMethod recordingMethod;
WorkoutSummary? workoutSummary;
```

where a [`HealthValue`](https://pub.dev/documentation/health/latest/health/HealthValue-class.html) can be any type of `AudiogramHealthValue`, `ElectrocardiogramHealthValue`, `ElectrocardiogramVoltageValue`, `NumericHealthValue`, `NutritionHealthValue`, or `WorkoutHealthValue`.

A `HealthDataPoint` object can be serialized to and from JSON using the `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods. JSON serialization is using camel_case notation. Null values are not serialized. For example;

```json
{
  "value": {
    "__type": "NumericHealthValue",
    "numeric_value": 141.0
  },
  "type": "STEPS",
  "unit": "COUNT",
  "date_from": "2024-04-03T10:06:57.736",
  "date_to": "2024-04-03T10:12:51.724",
  "source_platform": "appleHealth",
  "source_device_id": "F74938B9-C011-4DE4-AA5E-CF41B60B96E7",
  "source_id": "com.apple.health.81AE7156-EC05-47E3-AC93-2D6F65C717DF",
  "source_name": "iPhone12.bardram.net",
  "recording_method": 3
  "value": {
    "__type": "NumericHealthValue",
    "numeric_value": 141.0
  },
  "type": "STEPS",
  "unit": "COUNT",
  "date_from": "2024-04-03T10:06:57.736",
  "date_to": "2024-04-03T10:12:51.724",
  "source_platform": "appleHealth",
  "source_device_id": "F74938B9-C011-4DE4-AA5E-CF41B60B96E7",
  "source_id": "com.apple.health.81AE7156-EC05-47E3-AC93-2D6F65C717DF",
  "source_name": "iPhone12.bardram.net",
  "recording_method": 2
}
```

### Fetch health data

See the example app for a showcasing of how it's done.

**Note** On iOS the device must be unlocked before health data can be requested. Otherwise an error will be thrown:

```bash
flutter: Health Plugin Error:
flutter:  PlatformException(FlutterHealth, Results are null, Optional(Error Domain=com.apple.healthkit Code=6 "Protected health data is inaccessible" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Protected health data is inaccessible}))
```

### Fetch single health data by UUID

In order to retrieve a single record, it is required to provide `String uuid` and `HealthDataType type`.

Please see example below:
```dart
HealthDataPoint? healthPoint = await health.getHealthDataByUUID(
  uuid: 'random-uuid-string',
  type: HealthDataType.STEPS,
);
```
```
I/FLUTTER_HEALTH( 9161): Success: {uuid=random-uuid-string, value=12, date_from=1742259061009, date_to=1742259092888, source_id=, source_name=com.google.android.apps.fitness, recording_method=0}
```
> Assuming that the `uuid` and `type` are coming from your database.

### Filtering by recording method

Google Health Connect and Apple HealthKit both provide ways to distinguish samples collected "automatically" and manually entered data by the user.

- Android provides an enum with 4 variations: <https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/health/connect/client/records/metadata/Metadata#summary>
- iOS has a boolean value: <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkmetadatakeywasuserentered>

As such, when fetching data you have the option to filter the fetched data by recording method as such:

```dart
List<HealthDataPoint> healthData = await health.getHealthDataFromTypes(
  types: types,
  startTime: yesterday,
  endTime: now,
  recordingMethodsToFilter: [RecordingMethod.manual, RecordingMethod.unknown],
);
```

**Note that for this to work, the information needs to have been provided when writing the data to Health Connect or Apple Health**. For example, steps added manually through the Apple Health App will set `HKWasUserEntered` to true (corresponding to `RecordingMethod.manual`), however it seems that adding steps manually to Google Fit does not write the data with the `RecordingMethod.manual` in the metadata, instead it shows up as `RecordingMethod.unknown`. This is an open issue, and as such filtering manual entries when querying step count on Android with `getTotalStepsInInterval(includeManualEntries: false)` does not necessarily filter out manual steps.

**NOTE**: On iOS, you can only filter by `RecordingMethod.automatic` and `RecordingMethod.manual` as it is stored `HKMetadataKeyWasUserEntered` is a boolean value in the metadata.

### Filtering out duplicates

If the same data is requested multiple times and saved in the same array duplicates will occur.

A single data point can be compared to each other with the == operator, i.e.

```dart
HealthDataPoint p1 = ...;
HealthDataPoint p2 = ...;
bool same = p1 == p2;
```

If you have a list of data points, duplicates can be removed with:

```dart
List<HealthDataPoint> points = ...;
points = health.removeDuplicates(points);
```

### Android: Reading Health Data in Background
Currently health connect allows apps to read health data in the background. In order to achieve this add the following permission to your `AndroidManifest.XML`:
```XML
<!-- For reading data in background -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.health.READ_HEALTH_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND"/>
```
Furthermore, the plugin now exposes three new functions to help you check and request access to read data in the background:
1. `isHealthDataInBackgroundAvailable()`: Checks if the Health Data in Background feature is available
2. `isHealthDataInBackgroundAuthorized()`: Checks the current status of the Health Data in Background permission
3. `requestHealthDataInBackgroundAuthorization()`: Requests the Health Data in Background permission.

### Fetch single health data by UUID

In order to retrieve a single record, it is required to provide `String uuid` and `HealthDataType type`.

Please see example below:
```dart
HealthDataPoint? healthPoint = await health.getHealthDataByUUID(
  uuid: 'E9F2EEAD-8FC5-4CE5-9FF5-7C4E535FB8B8',
  type: HealthDataType.WORKOUT,
);
```
```
data by UUID: HealthDataPoint -
    uuid: E9F2EEAD-8FC5-4CE5-9FF5-7C4E535FB8B8,
    value: WorkoutHealthValue - workoutActivityType: RUNNING,
           totalEnergyBurned: null,
           totalEnergyBurnedUnit: KILOCALORIE,
           totalDistance: 2400,
           totalDistanceUnit: METER
           totalSteps: null,
           totalStepsUnit: null,
    unit: NO_UNIT,
    dateFrom: 2025-05-02 07:31:00.000,
    dateTo: 2025-05-02 08:25:00.000,
    dataType: WORKOUT,
    platform: HealthPlatformType.appleHealth,
    deviceId: unknown,
    sourceId: com.apple.Health,
    sourceName: Health
    recordingMethod: RecordingMethod.manual
    workoutSummary: WorkoutSummary - workoutType: runningtotalDistance: 2400, totalEnergyBurned: 0, totalSteps: 0
    metadata: null
    deviceModel: null
```
> Assuming that the `uuid` and `type` are coming from your database.


## Data Types

The plugin supports the following [`HealthDataType`](https://pub.dev/documentation/health/latest/health/HealthDataType.html).

| **Data Type**                | **Unit**                | **Apple Health** | **Google Health Connect** | **Comments**                                                                                                                       |
